# TimeToDecimalConverter
Tiny program with simple GUI built specifically to convert all HH:MM:SS time formats to decimal format in .csv files.
It's only dependency is on JUnit 4.8.2.

To install:
  -Pull down into any IDE with Maven plugin (or just clone the URI and use Maven manually), package, and go.
  
 Use:
  -While this program is designed only for .csv files, other types of files shouldn't break it -- they just won't be processed.
  -Otherwise, the GUI is pretty straightforward.
  
 Plans:
  -Other types of time formats do exist, but for the scope of this program (and my use of it), only the one is used.  Other types
    could easily be planned for in the future.
  -Other file types may be feasible, but I have yet to consider them.
